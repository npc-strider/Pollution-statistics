	"description": "Emulates the pollution statistics in the Factorio campaign. The resulting value is the relative pollution value, not an absolute one. Note that this mod only works with two forces: player and enemy(biters), and biters must be present to calculate the pollution statistic - it is not suitable with multiple factions."
