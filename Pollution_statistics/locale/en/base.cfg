[mod-setting-description]
stat-display-rate=(Default 15, Min 1, Max INF.) How often (in ticks) does the mod graph the result data. Note that this option must not equal the lower option. At 1, the graph is perfect to the data supplied, but has a large UPS cost. 60 is a good starting point for UPS efficiency. Campaign default: 240.
stat-polling-rate=(Default 180, Min 1, Max INF.) How often (in ticks) does the mod poll the pollution level. Note that this option must not equal the upper option. Higher value generate less accurate data, but have less of a UPS cost. Campaign default: 240.
stat-scale-constant=(Default 400) Affects the vertical scale of the pollution graph. Note that changing this value in an existing save will not affect data generated after the change, meaning it will be distorted in comparison to the current scaled data. The scale of the graph is a reciprocal of this value. Campaign default: 800
